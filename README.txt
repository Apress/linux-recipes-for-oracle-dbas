This is the README.txt for Linux Recipes for Oracle DBAs, first edition.

The scripts are located in the Chapter folders. We didn't include every
script in the book, rather we created files for the larger scripts that
would be unwieldy to type in.

The scripts follow the naming convention of:
<chapterNumber>_<scriptPurpose>.txt

We saved all of the files as .txt files, so you'll have to change
the .txt extention to fit your use of the script (like .sql, .bsh, .ksh,
and so on).

If you have any questions, corrections, or suggestions, please email
me directly at:

thanks.
